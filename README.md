# chess-2
2nd attempt at doing something with chess

Goal: 
Work AS FAST AS POSSIBLE to create a working chess bot, any working chess bot, before 12/1/2024 (or 1/12/2024 for Europeans)

See [LeopardBot](https://github.com/LeopardCheetah/LeopardBot) repo for the whole overall structure + other information.    


Update: I failed my target goal :c.  
I'll hopefully finish it up today (12/8)   


update 2: I HAVE FINISHED (kinda)  
    

update 3: I am now (attempting to) deploy my code to [lichess](https://lichess.org) via my [LeopardBot](https://github.com/LeopardCheetah/LeopardBot) repo.

update 4 (03/21/2025): This repo is archived (see [a blog post i kind of wrote on this](https://thelonewolf.bearblog.dev/on-wheel-making/)). I'll build off of this in the future, but this repo itself is not going to move.
