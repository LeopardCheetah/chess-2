# chess-2
2nd attempt at doing something with chess

Goal: 
Work AS FAST AS POSSIBLE to create a working chess bot, any working chess bot, before 12/1/2024 (or 1/12/2024 for Europeans)

See [LeopardBot](https://github.com/LeopardCheetah/LeopardBot) repo for the whole overall structure + other information.    


Update: I failed my target goal :c.  
I'll hopefully finish it up today (12/8)
